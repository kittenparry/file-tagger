-    save tags in a dictionary to a db?
-    	{path: "tags as a string separated by spaces"}
-    get all path from the dictionary with the tags to display tagged ones onscreen
-    select checkbox with clicking over the image
-        make bg blue like that of the button?
-        invis checkbox?
-    select tags by clicking and a display button below to display them
        also a check all button? maybe instead display all tagged
    files select all to absolute top left?
-    files path to something like li fixed top 100% width?
-    overall less padding/margin on buttons?
    probably should re-render tags after changing them in the iframe
-    put select all to the fixed div as well
    path to the files above (outside) the iframe?
    don't accept empty "" text as tags
    on-click a folder from the tree display a loading of sorts?
